										<td class="answer">In order to arrange a pop song for a-cappella, I had to re-write the song for four vocal parts in musical
										notation with my knowledge of musical theory. I listened to the original song by One Republic
										for inspiration, but ended up adding many different musical features, like new phrasing, dynamics, crunchy
										chords and rhythm. Aspiring to make this song a UBC A-cappella favorite, I worked hard to ensure that it was
										interesting, fun to sing and within the ranges of the singers. This was the first time that I have written
										in musical notation to create an arrangement, but it resulted as a success. My group originally it sung for our
										a-cappella end of the year concert (check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnNVeIdj5BM">here</a>),
										but because many members of a-cappella enjoyed it, I redid the piece for the International Championship of Collegiate
										A-cappella in Bellingham, Washington. We integrated choreography with the vocals of the piece and I sang the solo.
										Check this performance out on	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjBFIWHkvCw">Youtube</a>. "Love Runs Out" starts at 7:16.

										The goal of our project was to create a shoebox-sized car that would travel a set distance, carrying
										a set weight of water. The more accurate our car's travelled distance was to the given value, the
										higher we placed. We were not allowed to use any devices to measure the distance travelled, nor use
										a commercial battery to power the motor, meaning that we had to build our own chemical stopping mechanism
										and chemical power source for the car. More details about the competition can be found
										<a href="">here</a>. As Reactor Team Lead, I was in charge of developing the reactor that held the chemical
										timer for the car. I had to implement placement for the sensors and circuitry, create and maintain optimal
										conditions for the chemical reaction and ensure stability of the reactor onto the car when the car is mobile.

									the motor, the tubing and the Fuel Cell, I took into account variables like voltage output from the Fuel Cell, required voltage input to the Electrolyzer,
									and tubing diameter. After I ordered an Electrolyzer online from the <span>The Fuel Cell Store</span>, our team started to design apparatus to transport
								 	Hydrogen gas from an Electrolyzer into a Fuel Cell on a moving car. Because the Electrolyzer is too big, we cannot put it on the car. We would need to
									generate Hydrogen, put it into temporary storage, then attach that storage to the car to feed Hydrogen to the fuel cell. We ended up transporting the
									gas with a balloon and succeeded in moving the car for two minutes, which is a lot more time than we need.</td>

										received a lot of familiarity with the processes,	operations and environment of a manufacturing plant. Quality was the top priority at this plant because
										food requires strict regulations. I learned to implement product quality into my work ethic and always have the consumer in mind when working on the product.
										Furthermore, I worked on pasteurization of the tofu, which is a method of sustaining the food quality for longer periods of time. I learned how to operate
										a gantry or crane, and I would load carts of about 200 tofu products each into a hot water bath and then a cold water bath for set amounts of time. As a
										pasteurization worker, I had to deal with many carts at a time, which meant i have to keep track of 8 different water baths and transport carts in and out of

										in a time of two weeks. For every step, I needed to take a good quality picture that was to be edited and formatted professionally. When I was out in
										the field, the technicians were in very different steps of the process, so I had to create a system in which I could easily fit new steps into
										random spots of the procedure. I learned how to read Engineering drawings in order to understand where certain parts were being placed. I learned about
										the fundamentals of welding and grinding objects and also the power tools that the technicians used to shape metal the way they needed it. When I was
										not out in the field, I was building my procedure through macros on Word and formatting my photos with simple functions of Photoshop. By the end of
